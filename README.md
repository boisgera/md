# md

![Lean Build](https://github.com/boisgera/md/workflows/Lean%20Action%20CI/badge.svg)

Tiny Markdown document generator for Lean.

Execute e.g.

```
md MyLeanFile.lean
```

to generate a `MyLeanFile.lean.md` file.

  - Lean code is converted to Markdown code blocks,

  - Lean comments that start with "\-!" (aka module documentation) 
    are converted to markdown, the others stay verbatim in code blocks.

## Install

[Install the Lean toolchain](https://lean-lang.org/install/), 
then inside this project directory, run

```
lake run install
```
